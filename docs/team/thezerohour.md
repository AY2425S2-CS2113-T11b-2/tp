</h2>
Grand Rhombus aims to provide <span style="color:blue;">CEG Students</span> with an <span style="color:green;">Academic Life Planner</span> which is <span style="color:red;"> in-depth </span> and <span style="color:red;"> clear </span> to plan their future.

This planner <span style="color:red;">reduces confusion</span> from having to cross-reference multiple sources so that students <span style="color:red;">do not miss academic opportunities</span>.
